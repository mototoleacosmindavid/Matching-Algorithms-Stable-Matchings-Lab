# Matching Algorithm Configurations

This project contains various configurations to demonstrate different lab requirements for matching algorithms. Each configuration is implemented in the `configuration` package and illustrates specific tasks from compulsory and optional categories, as well as bonus tasks.

## Configurations

### 1. **Compulsory**
This configuration contains the implementation of all the requirements from the **Compulsory** category of the assignment.

### 2. **PriorityAssignment**
This configuration includes the implementation of an algorithm for matching creation, focusing on priority-based assignments.

### 3. **RandomNamesStartPoint**
Implements the requirement that uses random fake names to create the initial matching setup.

### 4. **EqualPriorityStartPoint** (Bonus 1)
Demonstrates the possibility of having equal preferences, allowing ties between participants in the matching process.

### 5. **GaleShapleyStartPoint** (Bonus 2)
Implements the **Gale-Shapley** algorithm to find a stable matching, ensuring no pair of participants would prefer each other over their current match.

### 6. **MultipleMatching** (Bonus 3)
This configuration provides an example that demonstrates the possibility of having multiple stable matchings. The requirement for this can also be easily demonstrated theoretically.

## Optional Category

The combination of all the above classes constitutes the first requirement from the **Optional** category.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Navigate to the desired configuration class under the `configuration` package.
4. Run the selected class to see the matching algorithm in action.

### Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- [Optional] A build tool like Maven or Gradle can be used to manage dependencies.
